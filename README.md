# WindowsAnsible
This script is designed to be run on a new machine running Windows 10 latest release. In order to prep this machine for use with Ansible, the WinRM Listener needs to be configured on the Windows node. We also will require a local Administrator account for Ansible to perform it's magic. I have setup a student user with the password student for this deployment. WinRM setup can be accomplished with the following steps:
1. Open PowerShell as an Administrator
2. Run the following commands:
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file


3. Once Complete, check the listener and verify it is listening and on what IP address you can connect together on. You will need to add this IP address to your /etc/hosts file so your machine can connect to the Windows machine by name. Here is an example output:
Listener
    Address = *
    Transport = HTTP
    Port = 5985
    Hostname
    Enabled = true
    URLPrefix = wsman
    CertificateThumbprint
    ListeningOn = 10.0.2.15, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.56.155, ::1, fe80::5efe:10.0.2.15%6, fe80::5efe:192.168.56.155%8, fe80::
ffff:ffff:fffe%2, fe80::203d:7d97:c2ed:ec78%3, fe80::e8ea:d765:2c69:7756%7

Listener
    Address = *
    Transport = HTTPS
    Port = 5986
    Hostname = SERVER2016
    Enabled = true
    URLPrefix = wsman
    CertificateThumbprint = E6CDAA82EEAF2ECE8546E05DB7F3E01AA47D76CE
    ListeningOn = 10.0.2.15, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.56.155, ::1, fe80::5efe:10.0.2.15%6, fe80::5efe:192.168.56.155%8, fe80::
ffff:ffff:fffe%2, fe80::203d:7d97:c2ed:ec78%3, fe80::e8ea:d765:2c69:7756%7

As you can see from this example, you would add the ip 192.168.56.155 to the /etc/hosts file on the control node.

sudo vim /etc/hosts

192.168.56.155 <name_chosen>

Make sure any name or names of your windows nodes are added to your inventory so it will properly deploy.
